  \item {My PhD research focused on detecting generalised tonic-clonic seizures in epilepsy patients using non-invasive, non-EEG sensors. I developed a method to differentiate phases of the ictal state by analysing acceleration and electrocardiographic waveforms in the time domain, enabling precise identification of seizure onset and cessation. This work contributed to the creation of the worldâ€™s largest epilepsy database of non-EEG recordings, now utilised by researchers at Oxford, Harvard, and the University of Paris. At the IntSaV (Intelligent Sensing and Vision) Research Laboratory, I conducted one-dimensional time series analysis for epilepsy and collaborated on computer vision research for cardiovascular studies using active learning. We submitted this research to the IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Impact Factor: 7.4), which is among the top 3 journals in biomedical and health informatics. The manuscript is currently in the second phase of a comprehensive three-fold blind peer review process.}

      \item {Achieved distinction with a focus on advanced software system design, UML, Java, and Python for deep learning and natural language processing. My thesis involved a pilot study on generalised epilepsy, analysing non-electroencephalogram sensor data (acceleration, heart rate, stress, fatigue, and sleep patterns) over six months. I trained a multimodal, one-dimensional convolutional neural network for time-series detection that detects seizure onset.}
