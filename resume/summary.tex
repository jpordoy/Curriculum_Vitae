I am a dedicated professional with a diverse background in cutting-edge research, specialising in data science, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. During my doctoral studies, I pioneered non-electroencephalogram research for time-series detection of generalised onset seizures, significantly advancing our understanding of ictal phase activity. This work earned me the Marcia Worrell Award of Excellence, acknowledging my significant contributions to the field. In my postdoctoral research, I led a team investigating computer vision with a focus on facial detection, developing a novel algorithm that set new benchmarks in the field. I am actively engaged in Kaggle competitions, currently exploring a new approach for spinal compression detection using MRI images. As a lecturer at the University of West London, I teach database design, relational modelling, Python programming, and algorithms. My expertise extends to data science, data analysis, predictive modelling, and data design, making me proficient in driving technological advancements. I am now seeking to transition from academia to industry, eager to leverage my expertise in a dynamic environment. I am enthusiastic about contributing to forward-thinking companies and am willing to relocate internationally to achieve this goal. My commitment to innovation and growth positions me as a valuable asset to organisations poised for advancement.
