        \item {I was the lead author and AI engineer for an international collaboration between the University of West London and Prince Sultan University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, I led a team of five researchers and developers. We developed a facial emotion recognition framework to enhance engagement in e-learning contexts. I designed a temporal algorithm using an augmented MobileNet to compute the dominant emotion from a sequence of frames, addressing transitional emotions and micro-expressions that typically reduce algorithm performance. The results and a preprint of the IEEE submission are available [here]. The manuscript is currently under review with IEEE.}
